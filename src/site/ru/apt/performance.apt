Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site

  The Exceptional Performance team has identified a number of best practices for making web pages fast. The list includes
  35 best practices divided into 7 categories.

* Minimize HTTP Requests

  80% of the end-user response time is spent on the front-end. Most of this time is tied up in downloading all the components
  in the page: images, stylesheets, scripts, Flash, etc. Reducing the number of components in turn reduces the number of HTTP
  requests required to render the page. This is the key to faster pages.

  One way to reduce the number of components in the page is to simplify the page's design. But is there a way to build pages
  with richer content while also achieving fast response times? Here are some techniques for reducing the number of HTTP
  requests, while still supporting rich page designs.

  <<Combined files>> are a way to reduce the number of HTTP requests by combining all scripts into a single script, and
  similarly combining all CSS into a single stylesheet. Combining files is more challenging when the scripts and stylesheets
  vary from page to page, but making this part of your release process improves response times.

  {{{http://alistapart.com/articles/sprites}CSS Sprites}} are the preferred method for reducing the number of image requests.
  Combine your background images into a single image and use the CSS <<<background-image>>> and <<<background-position>>>
  properties to display the desired image segment.

  {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.6}Image maps}} combine multiple images into a single image. The
  overall size is about the same, but reducing the number of HTTP requests speeds up the page. Image maps only work if the
  images are contiguous in the page, such as a navigation bar. Defining the coordinates of image maps can be tedious and
  error prone. Using image maps for navigation is not accessible too, so it's not recommended.

  <<Inline images>> use the {{{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397}data: URL scheme}} to embed the image data in the actual
  page. This can increase the size of your HTML document. Combining inline images into your (cached) stylesheets is a way
  to reduce HTTP requests and avoid increasing the size of your pages. Inline images are not yet supported across all major
  browsers.

  Reducing the number of HTTP requests in your page is the place to start. This is the most important guideline for improving
  performance for first time visitors. As described in Tenni Theurer's blog post
  {{{http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/04/performance-research-part-2/}Browser Cache Usage - Exposed!}}, 40-60% of daily visitors
  to your site come in with an empty cache. Making your page fast for these first time visitors is key to a better user
  experience.

* Use a Content Delivery Network

  The user's proximity to your web server has an impact on response times. Deploying your content across multiple,
  geographically dispersed servers will make your pages load faster from the user's perspective. But where should you
  start?

  As a first step to implementing geographically dispersed content, don't attempt to redesign your web application to work in
  a distributed architecture. Depending on the application, changing the architecture could include daunting tasks such as
  synchronizing session state and replicating database transactions across server locations. Attempts to reduce the distance
  between users and your content could be delayed by, or never pass, this application architecture step.

  Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time is spent downloading all the components in the page: images, stylesheets,
  scripts, Flash, etc. This is the Performance Golden Rule. Rather than starting with the difficult task of redesigning your
  application architecture, it's better to first disperse your static content. This not only achieves a bigger reduction in
  response times, but it's easier thanks to content delivery networks.

  A content delivery network (CDN) is a collection of web servers distributed across multiple locations to deliver content
  more efficiently to users. The server selected for delivering content to a specific user is typically based on a measure
  of network proximity. For example, the server with the fewest network hops or the server with the quickest response time
  is chosen.

  Some large Internet companies own their own CDN, but it's cost-effective to use a CDN service provider, such as
  {{{http://www.akamai.com/}Akamai Technologies}}, {{{http://www.edgecast.com/}EdgeCast}},
  {{{http://www.level3.com/index.cfm?pageID=36}or level3}}. For start-up companies and private web sites, the cost of a CDN
  service can be prohibitive, but as your target audience grows larger and becomes more global, a CDN is necessary to achieve
  fast response times. At Yahoo!, properties that moved static content off their application web servers to a CDN (both 3rd
  party as mentioned above as well as Yahooâ€™s own {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/TS/traffic-server.html}CDN}}) improved end-user
  response times by 20% or more. Switching to a CDN is a relatively easy code change that will dramatically improve the speed
  of your web site.

* Add an Expires or a Cache-Control Header

  There are two aspects to this rule:

  * For static components: implement "Never expire" policy by setting far future <<<Expires>>> header

  * For dynamic components: use an appropriate <<<Cache-Control>>> header to help the browser with conditional requests

  []

  Web page designs are getting richer and richer, which means more scripts, stylesheets, images, and Flash in the page.
  A first-time visitor to your page may have to make several HTTP requests, but by using the Expires header you make those
  components cacheable. This avoids unnecessary HTTP requests on subsequent page views. Expires headers are most often used
  with images, but they should be used on all components including scripts, stylesheets, and Flash components.

  Browsers (and proxies) use a cache to reduce the number and size of HTTP requests, making web pages load faster. A web server
  uses the Expires header in the HTTP response to tell the client how long a component can be cached. This is a far future
  Expires header, telling the browser that this response won't be stale until April 15, 2010.

----
Expires: Thu, 15 Apr 2010 20:00:00 GMT
----

  If your server is Apache, use the ExpiresDefault directive to set an expiration date relative to the current date. This
  example of the ExpiresDefault directive sets the Expires date 10 years out from the time of the request.

----
ExpiresDefault "access plus 10 years"
----

  Keep in mind, if you use a far future Expires header you have to change the component's filename whenever the component
  changes. At Yahoo! we often make this step part of the build process: a version number is embedded in the component's
  filename, for example, yahoo_2.0.6.js.

  Using a far future Expires header affects page views only after a user has already visited your site. It has no effect on
  the number of HTTP requests when a user visits your site for the first time and the browser's cache is empty. Therefore
  the impact of this performance improvement depends on how often users hit your pages with a primed cache. (A "primed cache"
  already contains all of the components in the page.) We
  {{{http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/04/performance-research-part-2/}measured this at Yahoo!}} and found the number of page
  views with a primed cache is 75-85%. By using a far future Expires header, you increase the number of components that are
  cached by the browser and re-used on subsequent page views without sending a single byte over the user's Internet connection.

* Gzip Components

  The time it takes to transfer an HTTP request and response across the network can be significantly reduced by decisions made
  by front-end engineers. It's true that the end-user's bandwidth speed, Internet service provider, proximity to peering
  exchange points, etc. are beyond the control of the development team. But there are other variables that affect response times.
  Compression reduces response times by reducing the size of the HTTP response.

  Starting with HTTP/1.1, web clients indicate support for compression with the Accept-Encoding header in the HTTP request.

----
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
----

  If the web server sees this header in the request, it may compress the response using one of the methods listed by the client.
  The web server notifies the web client of this via the Content-Encoding header in the response.

----
Content-Encoding: gzip
----

  Gzip is the most popular and effective compression method at this time. It was developed by the GNU project and standardized
  by {{{http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt}RFC 1952}}. The only other compression format you're likely to see is deflate, but
  it's less effective and less popular.

  Gzipping generally reduces the response size by about 70%. Approximately 90% of today's Internet traffic travels through
  browsers that claim to support gzip. If you use Apache, the module configuring gzip depends on your version: Apache 1.3
  uses {{{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-gzip/}mod_gzip}} while Apache 2.x uses
  {{{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-gzip/}mod_deflate}}.

  There are known issues with browsers and proxies that may cause a mismatch in what the browser expects and what it receives
  with regard to compressed content. Fortunately, these edge cases are dwindling as the use of older browsers drops off.
  The Apache modules help out by adding appropriate Vary response headers automatically.

  Servers choose what to gzip based on file type, but are typically too limited in what they decide to compress.
  Most web sites gzip their HTML documents. It's also worthwhile to gzip your scripts and stylesheets, but many web sites miss
  this opportunity. In fact, it's worthwhile to compress any text response including XML and JSON. Image and PDF files should
  not be gzipped because they are already compressed. Trying to gzip them not only wastes CPU but can potentially increase
  file sizes.

  Gzipping as many file types as possible is an easy way to reduce page weight and accelerate the user experience.

* Put Stylesheets at the Top

  While researching performance at Yahoo!, we discovered that moving stylesheets to the document HEAD makes pages appear to be
  loading faster. This is because putting stylesheets in the HEAD allows the page to render progressively.

  Front-end engineers that care about performance want a page to load progressively; that is, we want the browser to display
  whatever content it has as soon as possible. This is especially important for pages with a lot of content and for users on
  slower Internet connections. The importance of giving users visual feedback, such as progress indicators, has been well
  researched and {{{http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html}documented}}. In our case the HTML page is the progress
  indicator! When the browser loads the page progressively the header, the navigation bar, the logo at the top, etc. all serve
  as visual feedback for the user who is waiting for the page. This improves the overall user experience.

  The problem with putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is that it prohibits progressive rendering in many
  browsers, including Internet Explorer. These browsers block rendering to avoid having to redraw elements of the page if their
  styles change. The user is stuck viewing a blank white page.

  The {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#h-12.3}HTML specification}} clearly states that stylesheets are to be
  included in the HEAD of the page: "Unlike A, [LINK] may only appear in the HEAD section of a document, although it may appear
  any number of times." Neither of the alternatives, the blank white screen or flash of unstyled content, are worth the risk.
  The optimal solution is to follow the HTML specification and load your stylesheets in the document HEAD.

* Put Scripts at the Bottom

  The problem caused by scripts is that they block parallel downloads. The
  {{{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.1.4}HTTP/1.1 specification}} suggests that browsers download no
  more than two components in parallel per hostname. If you serve your images from multiple hostnames, you can get more than
  two downloads to occur in parallel. While a script is downloading, however, the browser won't start any other downloads, even
  on different hostnames.

  In some situations it's not easy to move scripts to the bottom. If, for example, the script uses document.write to insert
  part of the page's content, it can't be moved lower in the page. There might also be scoping issues. In many cases, there
  are ways to workaround these situations.

  An alternative suggestion that often comes up is to use deferred scripts. The DEFER attribute indicates that the script does
  not contain <<<document.write>>>, and is a clue to browsers that they can continue rendering. Unfortunately, Firefox doesn't
  support the DEFER attribute. In Internet Explorer, the script may be deferred, but not as much as desired. If a script can be
  deferred, it can also be moved to the bottom of the page. That will make your web pages load faster.

* Avoid CSS Expressions

  CSS expressions are a powerful (and dangerous) way to set CSS properties dynamically. They were supported in Internet Explorer
  starting with version 5, but were deprecated starting with
  {{{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537634%28VS.85%29.aspx}IE8}}. As an example, the background color could be set to
  alternate every hour using CSS expressions:

----
background-color: expression( (new Date()).getHours()%2 ? "#B8D4FF" : "#F08A00" );
----

  As shown here, the <<<expression>>> method accepts a JavaScript expression. The CSS property is set to the result of
  evaluating the JavaScript expression. The <<<expression>>> method is ignored by other browsers, so it is useful for setting
  properties in Internet Explorer needed to create a consistent experience across browsers.

  The problem with expressions is that they are evaluated more frequently than most people expect. Not only are they evaluated
  when the page is rendered and resized, but also when the page is scrolled and even when the user moves the mouse over the page.
  Adding a counter to the CSS expression allows us to keep track of when and how often a CSS expression is evaluated. Moving
  the mouse around the page can easily generate more than 10,000 evaluations.

  One way to reduce the number of times your CSS expression is evaluated is to use one-time expressions, where the first time
  the expression is evaluated it sets the style property to an explicit value, which replaces the CSS expression. If the style
  property must be set dynamically throughout the life of the page, using event handlers instead of CSS expressions is an
  alternative approach. If you must use CSS expressions, remember that they may be evaluated thousands of times and could affect
  the performance of your page.

* Make JavaScript and CSS External

  Many of these performance rules deal with how external components are managed. However, before these considerations arise you
  should ask a more basic question: Should JavaScript and CSS be contained in external files, or inlined in the page itself?

  Using external files in the real world generally produces faster pages because the JavaScript and CSS files are cached by
  the browser. JavaScript and CSS that are inlined in HTML documents get downloaded every time the HTML document is requested.
  This reduces the number of HTTP requests that are needed, but increases the size of the HTML document. On the other hand,
  if the JavaScript and CSS are in external files cached by the browser, the size of the HTML document is reduced without
  increasing the number of HTTP requests.

  The key factor, then, is the frequency with which external JavaScript and CSS components are cached relative to the number
  of HTML documents requested. This factor, although difficult to quantify, can be gauged using various metrics. If users on
  your site have multiple page views per session and many of your pages re-use the same scripts and stylesheets, there is a
  greater potential benefit from cached external files.

  Many web sites fall in the middle of these metrics. For these sites, the best solution generally is to deploy the JavaScript
  and CSS as external files. The only exception where inlining is preferable is with home pages, such as
  {{{http://www.yahoo.com/}Yahoo!'s front page}} and {{{http://www.yahoo.com/}My Yahoo!}}. Home pages that have few (perhaps
  only one) page view per session may find that inlining JavaScript and CSS results in faster end-user response times.

  For front pages that are typically the first of many page views, there are techniques that leverage the reduction of HTTP
  requests that inlining provides, as well as the caching benefits achieved through using external files. One such technique
  is to inline JavaScript and CSS in the front page, but dynamically download the external files after the page has finished
  loading. Subsequent pages would reference the external files that should already be in the browser's cache.

* Reduce DNS Lookups

  The Domain Name System (DNS) maps hostnames to IP addresses, just as phonebooks map people's names to their phone numbers.
  When you type www.yahoo.com into your browser, a DNS resolver contacted by the browser returns that server's IP address.
  DNS has a cost. It typically takes 20-120 milliseconds for DNS to lookup the IP address for a given hostname. The browser
  can't download anything from this hostname until the DNS lookup is completed.

  DNS lookups are cached for better performance. This caching can occur on a special caching server, maintained by the user's
  ISP or local area network, but there is also caching that occurs on the individual user's computer. The DNS information
  remains in the operating system's DNS cache (the "DNS Client service" on Microsoft Windows). Most browsers have their own
  caches, separate from the operating system's cache. As long as the browser keeps a DNS record in its own cache, it doesn't
  bother the operating system with a request for the record.

  Internet Explorer caches DNS lookups for 30 minutes by default, as specified by the <<<DnsCacheTimeout>>> registry setting.
  Firefox caches DNS lookups for 1 minute, controlled by the <<<network.dnsCacheExpiration>>> configuration setting. (Fasterfox
  changes this to 1 hour.)

  When the client's DNS cache is empty (for both the browser and the operating system), the number of DNS lookups is equal to
  the number of unique hostnames in the web page. This includes the hostnames used in the page's URL, images, script files,
  stylesheets, Flash objects, etc. Reducing the number of unique hostnames reduces the number of DNS lookups.

  Reducing the number of unique hostnames has the potential to reduce the amount of parallel downloading that takes place in
  the page. Avoiding DNS lookups cuts response times, but reducing parallel downloads may increase response times. My guideline
  is to split these components across at least two but no more than four hostnames. This results in a good compromise between
  reducing DNS lookups and allowing a high degree of parallel downloads.

* Minify JavaScript and CSS

  Minification is the practice of removing unnecessary characters from code to reduce its size thereby improving load times.
  When code is minified all comments are removed, as well as unneeded white space characters (space, newline, and tab). In the
  case of JavaScript, this improves response time performance because the size of the downloaded file is reduced. Two popular
  tools for minifying JavaScript code are {{{http://crockford.com/javascript/jsmin}JSMin}} and
  {{{http://crockford.com/javascript/jsmin}YUI Compressor}}. The YUI compressor can also minify CSS.

  Obfuscation is an alternative optimization that can be applied to source code. It's more complex than minification and thus
  more likely to generate bugs as a result of the obfuscation step itself. In a survey of ten top U.S. web sites, minification
  achieved a 21% size reduction versus 25% for obfuscation. Although obfuscation has a higher size reduction, minifying
  JavaScript is less risky.

  In addition to minifying external scripts and styles, inlined <<<\<script\>>>> and <<<\<style\>>>> blocks can and should also
  be minified. Even if you gzip your scripts and styles, minifying them will still reduce the size by 5% or more. As the use and
  size of JavaScript and CSS increases, so will the savings gained by minifying your code.

* Avoid Redirects

  Redirects are accomplished using the 301 and 302 status codes. Here's an example of the HTTP headers in a 301 response:

----
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: http://example.com/newuri
Content-Type: text/html
----

  The browser automatically takes the user to the URL specified in the <<<Location>>> field. All the information necessary for a
  redirect is in the headers. The body of the response is typically empty. Despite their names, neither a 301 nor a 302
  response is cached in practice unless additional headers, such as <<<Expires>>> or <<<Cache-Control>>>, indicate it should be.
  The meta refresh tag and JavaScript are other ways to direct users to a different URL, but if you must do a redirect, the
  preferred technique is to use the standard 3xx HTTP status codes, primarily to ensure the back button works correctly.

  The main thing to remember is that redirects slow down the user experience. Inserting a redirect between the user and the
  HTML document delays everything in the page since nothing in the page can be rendered and no components can start being
  downloaded until the HTML document has arrived.

  One of the most wasteful redirects happens frequently and web developers are generally not aware of it. It occurs when a
  trailing slash (/) is missing from a URL that should otherwise have one. For example, going to
  {{http://astrology.yahoo.com/astrology}} results in a 301 response containing a redirect to
  {{http://astrology.yahoo.com/astrology/}} (notice the added trailing slash). This is fixed in Apache by using <<<Alias>>> or
  <<<mod_rewrite>>>, or the <<<DirectorySlash>>> directive if you're using Apache handlers.

  Connecting an old web site to a new one is another common use for redirects. Others include connecting different parts of a
  website and directing the user based on certain conditions (type of browser, type of user account, etc.). Using a redirect to
  connect two web sites is simple and requires little additional coding. Although using redirects in these situations reduces
  the complexity for developers, it degrades the user experience. Alternatives for this use of redirects include using
  <<<Alias>>> and <<<mod_rewrite>>> if the two code paths are hosted on the same server. If a domain name change is the cause
  of using redirects, an alternative is to create a CNAME (a DNS record that creates an alias pointing from one domain name to
  another) in combination with <<<Alias>>> or <<<mod_rewrite>>>.

* Remove Duplicate Scripts

  It hurts performance to include the same JavaScript file twice in one page. This isn't as unusual as you might think. A review
  of the ten top U.S. web sites shows that two of them contain a duplicated script. Two main factors increase the odds of a
  script being duplicated in a single web page: team size and number of scripts. When it does happen, duplicate scripts hurt
  performance by creating unnecessary HTTP requests and wasted JavaScript execution.

  Unnecessary HTTP requests happen in Internet Explorer, but not in Firefox. In Internet Explorer, if an external script is
  included twice and is not cacheable, it generates two HTTP requests during page loading. Even if the script is cacheable,
  extra HTTP requests occur when the user reloads the page.

  In addition to generating wasteful HTTP requests, time is wasted evaluating the script multiple times. This redundant
  JavaScript execution happens in both Firefox and Internet Explorer, regardless of whether the script is cacheable.

  One way to avoid accidentally including the same script twice is to implement a script management module in your templating
  system. The typical way to include a script is to use the SCRIPT tag in your HTML page.

----
<script type="text/javascript" src="menu_1.0.17.js"></script>
----

  An alternative in PHP would be to create a function called insertScript.

----
<?php insertScript("menu.js") ?>
----

  In addition to preventing the same script from being inserted multiple times, this function could handle other issues with
  scripts, such as dependency checking and adding version numbers to script filenames to support far future Expires headers.

* Configure ETags

  Entity tags (ETags) are a mechanism that web servers and browsers use to determine whether the component in the browser's
  cache matches the one on the origin server. (An "entity" is another word a "component": images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.)
  ETags were added to provide a mechanism for validating entities that is more flexible than the last-modified date. An ETag is
  a string that uniquely identifies a specific version of a component. The only format constraints are that the string be
  quoted. The origin server specifies the component's ETag using the <<<ETag>>> response header.

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Last-Modified: Tue, 12 Dec 2006 03:03:59 GMT
ETag: "10c24bc-4ab-457e1c1f"
Content-Length: 12195
----

  Later, if the browser has to validate a component, it uses the <<<If-None-Match>>> header to pass the ETag back to the origin
  server. If the ETags match, a 304 status code is returned reducing the response by 12195 bytes for this example.

----
GET /i/yahoo.gif HTTP/1.1
Host: us.yimg.com
If-Modified-Since: Tue, 12 Dec 2006 03:03:59 GMT
If-None-Match: "10c24bc-4ab-457e1c1f"
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
----

  The problem with ETags is that they typically are constructed using attributes that make them unique to a specific server
  hosting a site. ETags won't match when a browser gets the original component from one server and later tries to validate
  that component on a different server, a situation that is all too common on Web sites that use a cluster of servers to
  handle requests. By default, both Apache and IIS embed data in the ETag that dramatically reduces the odds of the validity
  test succeeding on web sites with multiple servers.

  The ETag format for Apache 1.3 and 2.x is <<<inode-size-timestamp>>>. Although a given file may reside in the same directory
  across multiple servers, and have the same file size, permissions, timestamp, etc., its inode is different from one server to
  the next.

  IIS 5.0 and 6.0 have a similar issue with ETags. The format for ETags on IIS is <<<Filetimestamp:ChangeNumber>>>. A
  <<<ChangeNumber>>> is a counter used to track configuration changes to IIS. It's unlikely that the <<<ChangeNumber>>> is the
  same across all IIS servers behind a web site.

  The end result is ETags generated by Apache and IIS for the exact same component won't match from one server to another.
  If the ETags don't match, the user doesn't receive the small, fast 304 response that ETags were designed for; instead,
  they'll get a normal 200 response along with all the data for the component. If you host your web site on just one server,
  this isn't a problem. But if you have multiple servers hosting your web site, and you're using Apache or IIS with the default
  ETag configuration, your users are getting slower pages, your servers have a higher load, you're consuming greater bandwidth,
  and proxies aren't caching your content efficiently. Even if your components have a far future <<<Expires>>> header, a
  conditional GET request is still made whenever the user hits Reload or Refresh.

  If you're not taking advantage of the flexible validation model that ETags provide, it's better to just remove the ETag
  altogether. The <<<Last-Modified>>> header validates based on the component's timestamp. And removing the ETag reduces the
  size of the HTTP headers in both the response and subsequent requests. This
  {{{http://support.microsoft.com/?id=922733}Microsoft Support article}} describes how to remove ETags. In Apache, this is done
  by simply adding the following line to your Apache configuration file:

----
FileETag none
----

* Make Ajax Cacheable

  One of the cited benefits of Ajax is that it provides instantaneous feedback to the user because it requests information
  asynchronously from the backend web server. However, using Ajax is no guarantee that the user won't be twiddling his thumbs
  waiting for those asynchronous JavaScript and XML responses to return. In many applications, whether or not the user is kept
  waiting depends on how Ajax is used. For example, in a web-based email client the user will be kept waiting for the results
  of an Ajax request to find all the email messages that match their search criteria. It's important to remember that
  "asynchronous" does not imply "instantaneous".

  To improve performance, it's important to optimize these Ajax responses. The most important way to improve the performance
  of Ajax is to make the responses cacheable, as discussed in Add an Expires or a Cache-Control Header. Some of the other rules
  also apply to Ajax:

  * Gzip Components

  * Reduce DNS Lookups

  * Minify JavaScript

  * Avoid Redirects

  * Configure ETags

  []

  Let's look at an example. A Web 2.0 email client might use Ajax to download the user's address book for autocompletion.
  If the user hasn't modified her address book since the last time she used the email web app, the previous address book
  response could be read from cache if that Ajax response was made cacheable with a future Expires or Cache-Control header.
  The browser must be informed when to use a previously cached address book response versus requesting a new one. This could be
  done by adding a timestamp to the address book Ajax URL indicating the last time the user modified her address book,
  for example, <<<&t=1190241612>>>. If the address book hasn't been modified since the last download, the timestamp will be
  the same and the address book will be read from the browser's cache eliminating an extra HTTP roundtrip. If the user has
  modified her address book, the timestamp ensures the new URL doesn't match the cached response, and the browser will request
  the updated address book entries.

  Even though your Ajax responses are created dynamically, and might only be applicable to a single user, they can still be
  cached. Doing so will make your Web 2.0 apps faster.

* Flush the Buffer Early

  When users request a page, it can take anywhere from 200 to 500ms for the backend server to stitch together the HTML page.
  During this time, the browser is idle as it waits for the data to arrive. In PHP you have the function
  {{{http://php.net/flush}flush()}}. It allows you to send your partially ready HTML response to the browser so that the browser
  can start fetching components while your backend is busy with the rest of the HTML page. The benefit is mainly seen on busy
  backends or light frontends.

  A good place to consider flushing is right after the HEAD because the HTML for the head is usually easier to produce and it
  allows you to include any CSS and JavaScript files for the browser to start fetching in parallel while the backend is still
  processing.

  Example:

----
  ... <!-- css, js -->
</head>
<?php flush(); ?>
<body>
  ... <!-- content -->
----

  {{{http://search.yahoo.com/}Yahoo! search}} pioneered research and real user testing to prove the benefits of using this
  technique.

* Use GET for AJAX Requests

  The {{{http://mail.yahoo.com/}Yahoo! Mail}} team found that when using XMLHttpRequest, POST is implemented in the browsers as
  a two-step process: sending the headers first, then sending data. So it's best to use GET, which only takes one TCP packet to
  send (unless you have a lot of cookies). The maximum URL length in IE is 2K, so if you send more than 2K data you might not
  be able to use GET.

  An interesting side affect is that POST without actually posting any data behaves like GET. Based on the
  {{{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html}HTTP specs}}, GET is meant for retrieving information, so it makes
  sense (semantically) to use GET when you're only requesting data, as opposed to sending data to be stored server-side.

* Post-load Components

  You can take a closer look at your page and ask yourself: "What's absolutely required in order to render the page initially?".
  The rest of the content and components can wait.

  JavaScript is an ideal candidate for splitting before and after the onload event. For example if you have JavaScript code
  and libraries that do drag and drop and animations, those can wait, because dragging elements on the page comes after the
  initial rendering. Other places to look for candidates for post-loading include hidden content (content that appears after
  a user action) and images below the fold.

  Tools to help you out in your effort: {{{http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imageloader/}YUI Image Loader}} allows you to delay
  images below the fold and the {{{http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/}YUI Get}} utility is an easy way to include JS and CSS
  on the fly. For an example in the wild take a look at {{{http://www.yahoo.com/}Yahoo! Home Page}} with Firebug's Net Panel
  turned on.

  It's good when the performance goals are inline with other web development best practices. In this case, the idea of
  progressive enhancement tells us that JavaScript, when supported, can improve the user experience but you have to make sure
  the page works even without JavaScript. So after you've made sure the page works fine, you can enhance it with some
  post-loaded scripts that give you more bells and whistles such as drag and drop and animations.

* Preload Components

  Preload may look like the opposite of post-load, but it actually has a different goal. By preloading components you can
  take advantage of the time the browser is idle and request components (like images, styles and scripts) you'll need in the
  future. This way when the user visits the next page, you could have most of the components already in the cache and your
  page will load much faster for the user.

  There are actually several types of preloading:

  * <Unconditional> preload - as soon as onload fires, you go ahead and fetch some extra components. Check google.com for an
  example of how a sprite image is requested onload. This sprite image is not needed on the google.com homepage, but it is
  needed on the consecutive search result page.

  * <Conditional> preload - based on a user action you make an educated guess where the user is headed next and preload
  accordingly. On {{search.yahoo.com}} you can see how some extra components are requested after you start typing in the
  input box.

  * <Anticipated> preload - preload in advance before launching a redesign. It often happens after a redesign that you hear:
  "The new site is cool, but it's slower than before". Part of the problem could be that the users were visiting your old site
  with a full cache, but the new one is always an empty cache experience. You can mitigate this side effect by preloading some
  components before you even launched the redesign. Your old site can use the time the browser is idle and request images and
  scripts that will be used by the new site.

* Reduce the Number of DOM Elements

  A complex page means more bytes to download and it also means slower DOM access in JavaScript. It makes a difference if you
  loop through 500 or 5000 DOM elements on the page when you want to add an event handler for example.

  A high number of DOM elements can be a symptom that there's something that should be improved with the markup of the page
  without necessarily removing content. Are you using nested tables for layout purposes? Are you throwing in more <<<\<div\>>>>s
  only to fix layout issues? Maybe there's a better and more semantically correct way to do your markup.

  A great help with layouts are the {{{http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/}YUI CSS utilities}}: grids.css can help you with the
  overall layout, fonts.css and reset.css can help you strip away the browser's defaults formatting. This is a chance to start
  fresh and think about your markup, for example use <div>s only when it makes sense semantically, and not because it renders
  a new line.

  The number of DOM elements is easy to test, just type in Firebug's console:

----
document.getElementsByTagName('*').length
----

  And how many DOM elements are too many? Check other similar pages that have good markup. For example the
  {{{http://www.yahoo.com/}Yahoo! Home Page}} is a pretty busy page and still under 700 elements (HTML tags).

* Split Components Across Domains

  Splitting components allows you to maximize parallel downloads. Make sure you're using not more than 2-4 domains because of
  the DNS lookup penalty. For example, you can host your HTML and dynamic content on <<<www.example.org>>> and split static
  components between <<<static1.example.org>>> and <<<static2.example.org>>>

  Tenni Theurer and Patty Chi.

* Minimize the Number of iframes

  Iframes allow an HTML document to be inserted in the parent document. It's important to understand how iframes work so they
  can be used effectively.

  <<<\<iframe\>>>> pros:

  * Helps with slow third-party content like badges and ads

  * Security sandbox

  * Download scripts in parallel

  []

  <<<\<iframe\>>>> cons:

  * Costly even if blank

  * Blocks page onload

  * Non-semantic

* No 404s

  HTTP requests are expensive so making an HTTP request and getting a useless response (i.e. 404 Not Found) is totally
  unnecessary and will slow down the user experience without any benefit.

  Some sites have helpful 404s "Did you mean X?", which is great for the user experience but also wastes server resources
  (like database, etc). Particularly bad is when the link to an external JavaScript is wrong and the result is a 404. First,
  this download will block parallel downloads. Next the browser may try to parse the 404 response body as if it were JavaScript
  code, trying to find something usable in it.

* Reduce Cookie Size

  HTTP cookies are used for a variety of reasons such as authentication and personalization. Information about cookies is
  exchanged in the HTTP headers between web servers and browsers. It's important to keep the size of cookies as low as
  possible to minimize the impact on the user's response time.

  For more information check {{{http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/03/01/performance-research-part-3/}"When the Cookie Crumbles"}} by
  Tenni Theurer and Patty Chi. The take-home of this research:

  * Eliminate unnecessary cookies

  * Keep cookie sizes as low as possible to minimize the impact on the user response time

  * Be mindful of setting cookies at the appropriate domain level so other sub-domains are not affected

  * Set an Expires date appropriately. An earlier Expires date or none removes the cookie sooner, improving the user response
  time

* Use Cookie-free Domains for Components

  When the browser makes a request for a static image and sends cookies together with the request, the server doesn't have
  any use for those cookies. So they only create network traffic for no good reason. You should make sure static components are
  requested with cookie-free requests. Create a subdomain and host all your static components there.

  If your domain is <<<www.example.org>>>, you can host your static components on <<<static.example.org>>>. However, if you've
  already set cookies on the top-level domain <<<example.org>>> as opposed to <<<www.example.org>>>, then all the requests to
  <<<static.example.org>>> will include those cookies. In this case, you can buy a whole new domain, host your static components
  there, and keep this domain cookie-free. Yahoo! uses <<<yimg.com>>>, YouTube uses <<<ytimg.com>>>, Amazon uses
  <<<images-amazon.com>>> and so on.

  Another benefit of hosting static components on a cookie-free domain is that some proxies might refuse to cache the components
  that are requested with cookies. On a related note, if you wonder if you should use <<<example.org>>> or <<<www.example.org>>>
  for your home page, consider the cookie impact. Omitting www leaves you no choice but to write cookies to <<<*.example.org>>>,
  so for performance reasons it's best to use the www subdomain and write the cookies to that subdomain.

* Minimize DOM Access

  Accessing DOM elements with JavaScript is slow so in order to have a more responsive page, you should:

  * Cache references to accessed elements

  * Update nodes "offline" and then add them to the tree

  * Avoid fixing layout with JavaScript

  * For more information check the YUI theatre's
  {{{http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/12/20/video-lecomte/}"High Performance Ajax Applications"}} by Julien Lecomte.

* Develop Smart Event Handlers

  Sometimes pages feel less responsive because of too many event handlers attached to different elements of the DOM tree
  which are then executed too often. That's why using event delegation is a good approach. If you have 10 buttons inside a
  <<<div>>>, attach only one event handler to the div wrapper, instead of one handler for each button. Events bubble up so
  you'll be able to catch the event and figure out which button it originated from.

  You also don't need to wait for the onload event in order to start doing something with the DOM tree. Often all you need is
  the element you want to access to be available in the tree. You don't have to wait for all images to be downloaded.
  <<<DOMContentLoaded>>> is the event you might consider using instead of onload, but until it's available in all browsers,
  you can use the {{{http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/}YUI Event}} utility, which has an
  {{{http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/#onavailable}onAvailable}} method.

* Choose \<link\> over @import

  One of the previous best practices states that CSS should be at the top in order to allow for progressive rendering.

  In IE <<<@import>>> behaves the same as using <<<\<link\>>>> at the bottom of the page, so it's best not to use it.

* Avoid Filters

  The IE-proprietary <<<AlphaImageLoader>>> filter aims to fix a problem with semi-transparent true color PNGs in IE
  versions \< 7. The problem with this filter is that it blocks rendering and freezes the browser while the image is being
  downloaded. It also increases memory consumption and is applied per element, not per image, so the problem is multiplied.

  The best approach is to avoid <<<AlphaImageLoader>>> completely and use gracefully degrading PNG8 instead, which are fine
  in IE. If you absolutely need <<<AlphaImageLoader>>>, use the underscore hack <<<_filter>>> as to not penalize your IE7+ users.

* Optimize Images

  After a designer is done with creating the images for your web page, there are still some things you can try before you FTP
  those images to your web server.

  * You can check the GIFs and see if they are using a palette size corresponding to the number of colors in the image.
  Using {{{http://www.imagemagick.org/}imagemagick}} it's easy to check using

----
identify -verbose image.gif
----

  When you see an image useing 4 colors and a 256 color "slots" in the palette, there is room for improvement.

  * Try converting GIFs to PNGs and see if there is a saving. More often than not, there is. Developers often hesitate to use
  PNGs due to the limited support in browsers, but this is now a thing of the past. The only real problem is alpha-transparency
  in true color PNGs, but then again, GIFs are not true color and don't support variable transparency either. So anything a
  GIF can do, a palette PNG (PNG8) can do too (except for animations). This simple imagemagick command results in totally
  safe-to-use PNGs:

----
convert image.gif image.png
----

  "All we are saying is: Give PiNG a Chance!"

  * Run {{{http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/}pngcrush}} (or any other PNG optimizer tool) on all your PNGs. Example:

----
pngcrush image.png -rem alla -reduce -brute result.png
----

  * Run jpegtran on all your JPEGs. This tool does lossless JPEG operations such as rotation and can also be used to optimize
  and remove comments and other useless information (such as EXIF information) from your images.

----
jpegtran -copy none -optimize -perfect src.jpg dest.jpg
----

* Optimize CSS Sprites

  * Arranging the images in the sprite horizontally as opposed to vertically usually results in a smaller file size.

  * Combining similar colors in a sprite helps you keep the color count low, ideally under 256 colors so to fit in a PNG8.

  * "Be mobile-friendly" and don't leave big gaps between the images in a sprite. This doesn't affect the file size as much
  but requires less memory for the user agent to decompress the image into a pixel map. 100x100 image is 10 thousand pixels,
  where 1000x1000 is 1 million pixels

* Don't Scale Images in HTML

  Don't use a bigger image than you need just because you can set the width and height in HTML. If you need

----
<img width="100" height="100" src="mycat.jpg" alt="My Cat" />
----

  then your image (mycat.jpg) should be 100x100px rather than a scaled down 500x500px image.

* Make favicon.ico Small and Cacheable

  The favicon.ico is an image that stays in the root of your server. It's a necessary evil because even if you don't care
  about it the browser will still request it, so it's better not to respond with a <<<404 Not Found>>>. Also since it's on the
  same server, cookies are sent every time it's requested. This image also interferes with the download sequence, for example in
  IE when you request extra components in the onload, the favicon will be downloaded before these extra components.

  So to mitigate the drawbacks of having a favicon.ico make sure:

  * It's small, preferably under 1K.

  * Set Expires header with what you feel comfortable (since you cannot rename it if you decide to change it). You can probably
  safely set the Expires header a few months in the future. You can check the last modified date of your current
  favicon.ico to make an informed decision.

  {{{http://www.imagemagick.org/}Imagemagick}} can help you create small favicons.

* Keep Components under 25K

  This restriction is related to the fact that iPhone won't cache components bigger than 25K. Note that this is the
  uncompressed size. This is where minification is important because gzip alone may not be sufficient.

  {{{http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/02/06/iphone-cacheability/}"Performance Research, Part 5: iPhone Cacheability - Making it Stick"}}
  by Wayne Shea and Tenni Theurer.

* Pack Components into a Multipart Document

  Packing components into a multipart document is like an email with attachments, it helps you fetch several components with
  one HTTP request (remember: HTTP requests are expensive). When you use this technique, first check if the user agent supports
  it (iPhone does not).

* Avoid Empty Image src

  Image with empty string src attribute occurs more than one will expect. It appears in two form:

  [[1]] straight HTML
----
<img src="">
----

  [[2]] JavaScript
----
var img = new Image();
img.src = "";
----

  []

  Both forms cause the same effect: browser makes another request to your server.

  * <<Internet Explorer>> makes a request to the directory in which the page is located.

  * <<Safari and Chrome>> make a request to the actual page itself.

  * <<Firefox>> 3 and earlier versions behave the same as Safari and Chrome, but version 3.5 addressed this
  issue{{{https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444931}[bug 444931]}} and no longer sends a request.

  * <<Opera>> does not do anything when an empty image src is encountered.

  []

  <<Why is this behavior bad?>>

  [[1]] Cripple your servers by sending a large amount of unexpected traffic, especially for pages that get millions of page
  views per day.

  [[2]] Waste server computing cycles generating a page that will never be viewed.

  [[3]] Possibly corrupt user data. If you are tracking state in the request, either by cookies or in another way, you have
  the possibility of destroying data. Even though the image request does not return an image, all of the headers are read and
  accepted by the browser, including all cookies. While the rest of the response is thrown away, the damage may already be done.

  []

  The root cause of this behavior is the way that URI resolution is performed in browsers. This behavior is defined in
  RFC 3986 - Uniform Resource Identifiers. When an empty string is encountered as a URI, it is considered a relative URI and
  is resolved according to the algorithm defined in section 5.2. This specific example, an empty string, is listed in
  section 5.4. Firefox, Safari, and Chrome are all resolving an empty string correctly per the specification, while
  Internet Explorer is resolving it incorrectly, apparently in line with an earlier version of the specification,
  RFC 2396 - Uniform Resource Identifiers (this was obsoleted by RFC 3986). So technically, the browsers are doing what they
  are supposed to do to resolve relative URIs. The problem is that in this context, the empty string is clearly unintentional.

  HTML5 adds to the description of the  tag's src attribute to instruct browsers not to make an additional request in
  section 4.8.2:

    The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid URL referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated, image
    resource that is neither paged nor scripted. If the base URI of the element is the same as the document's address, then
    the src attribute's value must not be the empty string.

  Hopefully, browsers will not have this problem in the future. Unfortunately, there is no such clause for \<script src=""\>
  and \<link href=""\>. Maybe there is still time to make that adjustment to ensure browsers don't accidentally implement
  this behavior.

  This rule was inspired by Yahoo!'s JavaScript guru Nicolas C. Zakas. For more information check out his article
